  The Manager
  Amana Bank PLC
  No. 486, 
  Galle Road, 
  Colombo 03. 

  Dear Sir,

  <u>FACILITY TERM SHEET - DIMINISHING MUSHARAKA VEHICLE PURCHASE</u>  
  <u>(TERM FINANCE-VEHICLE PURCHASE)</u>

  The facility Amount, Tenure, Pricing and purpose of the facility are 
  mentioned in the Item II of Schedule A.

  <u>Product Structure</u>

    a) Amana Bank PLC will invest a sum of Rupees, as per Item II of
       Schedule -A into the Vehicle as described in Item III of Schedule
       A and will become co-owners of the Vehicle. The purchasing value of
       the Vehicle as mentioned in Item II of Schedule -A will be divided 
       into number of units. The total number of units of the Vehicle and
       the units will own by the Bank and me/us are mentioned in Item II of
       Schedule -A. Thereby the ownership in percentage between Amana Bank PLC
       and me/us at the commencement is mentioned in Item IV of Schedule -A 
       respectively. Thereafter, every time I/we purchase a unit of Amana Bank
       PLC’s share, my/our ownership will increase by the percentage as depicted 
       in the Payment Structure herewith. 	

    b) Amana Bank PLC, being the co-owner, will allow me/us to use Amana Bank PLC’s
       share of ownership in the Vehicle, which I/we will hold on trust till such 
       time I/we will purchase Amana Bank PLC’s units as per the agreed terms and 
       conditions stated herein, on a leasehold basis over the facility tenure as 
       mentioned in Item II of Schedule -A on the basis of paying Amana Bank PLC a
       monthly rental as shown in Column B of the payment structure. For this purpose
       I/we will enter into a Lease Agreement with Amana Bank PLC.
       <span class="html2pdf__page-break"></span>
       The first month lease rental indicated in Column B of the payment structure 
       will reduce over the lease period of the remaining months. When I/we purchase 
       units of Amana Bank PLC’s share I/we will progressively increase my/our percentage 
       of ownership in the Vehicle as indicated in Column F of the Payment Structure. 
      
    c) The monthly payment indicated in Column D of payment structure will be towards 
       purchasing a single unit and meeting the monthly lease rental for availing the 
       lease on the Vehicle. However, the monthly payment could vary in the event of any 
       changes in the rental due to changes in market conditions.

       Accordingly Amana Bank PLC’s relinquishment of ownership of the Vehicle will be 
       completed at the end of the facility tenure subject to payment being recovered on 
       due dates. However, I /we are allowed to pay for any number of units at any time 
       during the tenor of this facility.   

    
    Initials: 	__________________
                Mr.<span id="cstName7"></span>

    d)  <b>If I delay in completing the purchase of the units, lease rental will then 
        continue to be the monthly lease rental applicable to that unit that remain 
        to be purchased until such time as that unit is paid for.</b> 

    e)  All payments made by me/us during the currency of this facility will be applied
        firstly in recovering the lease rentals for leasing the Vehicle and the balance
        amount if any as payment for the purchase as defined in the attached payment 
        structure.

        I/We accept the Payment Structure herewith, will constitute an integral part of 
        this document.
        <span class="html2pdf__page-break"></span>
<u><b>Acceptance</u></b> 

I/We have fully understood the above facility with regard to the product form, nature, 
structure and pricing computations including the application of additional rentals.

Further I/we also agree to buy the total units of Amana Bank PLC’s share of the Vehicle
from the Bank over the unit purchasing period as mentioned in Item II of Schedule -A , 
at the amount indicated in Payment Structure. In this regard my/our payment to the Bank 
for this purpose shall imply an offer to purchase by me/us and an acceptance of the payment
by Amana Bank PLC shall imply confirmation of sale of same from Amana Bank PLC.
